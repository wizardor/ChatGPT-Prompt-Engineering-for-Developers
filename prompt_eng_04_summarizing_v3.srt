1
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,633
There's so much sex in today's world,
pretty much

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,966
none of us have enough time to read
all the things we wish we had time to.

3
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:15,200
So one of the most exciting applications
I've seen of large

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,366
language models,
this is use it to summarize text.

5
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,133
And this is something that I'm seeing

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,700
multiple teams
built into multiple software applications.

7
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:26,700
You can do this in the chat
GBC web interface.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,466
I do this all the time to summarize
articles, so I can just kind of read

9
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:32,666
the content of many will articles
in my previous to code.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,133
And you want to do this
more programmatically.

11
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:39,366
You'll see how to in this lesson
so that let's take in the code

12
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:42,700
to see how you can use this yourself
to summarize sex.

13
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:47,433
So let's start off with the same article
as you saw before of import over there.

14
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:51,666
I know the API key
and here's that completion helper function

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to use as the running example.

16
00:00:56,566 --> 00:01:01,100
The task of summarizing
this product review got suspended

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,166
last week for a daughter's birthday
who loves it and takes it everywhere.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,066
And so on and so on.

19
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,933
If you're building an e-commerce website

20
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,100
and there's
just a large volume of reviews,

21
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:17,033
having a tool to summarize
the lengthy reviews could give you a way

22
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,566
to very quickly glance over more reviews
to get a better sense

23
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,800
of what all your customers are thinking.

24
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:26,300
So here's a prompt
for generating a summary.

25
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,033
Your task is generated.

26
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,266
Short summary of our probably review
from e-commerce website.

27
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,433
Summarize review below and so on.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,433
In that most three words

29
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,966
and so this is something cute

30
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:43,066
panda plush toys that buy daughter bismol
for the price arrive early.

31
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:47,400
Oh that's pretty good summary
and as you saw in the previous video

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,633
you can also play with things
like controlling the character count

33
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:54,866
or the number of sentences
to affect the length of this summary.

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,433
Now, sometimes when creating a summary,
if you have a very specific purpose

35
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:03,600
in mind for the summary, for example,
if you want to give feedback

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,100
to the shipping department,
you can also modify the prompt

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,966
to reflect that so that it can generate
a summary that is more applicable

38
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,900
to one particular group in your business.

39
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:20,500
So for example, if I adds to give feedback

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,233
to the

41
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,133
shipping
department that say I change this,

42
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:31,366
to tend to focus on
any aspects that mention

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,500
shipping and delivery of the product.

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,533
And if I run this, then

45
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,000
again you get a summary.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,600
But instead of starting off
with something, you panned a plush toy.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,933
It now focuses on the fact that it arrived
a day earlier than expected.

48
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,333
And then the store has other details that

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,200
or as another example,

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,033
if we aren't trying to give feedback
to the shipping department,

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,700
but let's say we want to give feedback

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:09,366
to the pricing department.

53
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:12,100
So the pricing department is

54
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,900
responsible for determining
the price of the product, and

55
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,233
I'm going to tell it to focus on

56
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,966
any aspects of relevance,
The price and perceived value.

57
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:27,433
Then this generates a different summary

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,366
that it says.

59
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:32,200
So maybe
the price may be too high for a size.

60
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,833
Now in the summary that I've generated
for the shipping department

61
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,000
or the pricing department, it focus a bit

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,166
more on information relevant
to those specific departments.

63
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,900
And in fact, feel free to pause the video
now and maybe ask it

64
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:52,033
to generate information
for the product department

65
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:56,133
responsible for the customer experience
of the product or for something else

66
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:01,733
that you think might be interesting
to an e-commerce site.

67
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:05,233
But in these summaries,
even though it generated information

68
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,966
relevant to shipping,
had some of the information

69
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:11,966
to which you could decide
may or may not be helpful.

70
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:15,633
So depending on
how you want to summarize it,

71
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:19,633
you can also ask it to extract information

72
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
rather than summarize it.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,766
So here's a prompts
that says it has to extract relevant

74
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,966
information
to give feedback to shipping department.

75
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:33,733
And now it just says product arrives a day
earlier than expected

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,533
without all of the other information,
which was also helpful

77
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:41,700
in a general summary, but less specific
to the shipping department,

78
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,000
if I wants to know, is
what happened with the shipping.

79
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:46,233
Lastly, let me just

80
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:51,066
share with you a concrete example
for how to use this in a workflow to help

81
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,733
summarize multiple reviews
to make them easier to read.

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,366
So here are a few reviews.

83
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,300
This is kind of long, but here's
the second review for a seminar.

84
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,800
Neither from a bedroom.

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,200
His a review from a lecture Toothbrush.

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,400
My dental hygiene is recommended

87
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,566
kind of a long review
about the electric toothbrush.

88
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,566
This is a review from Blender
when they said sell said

89
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,600
17 piece system on seasonal sale and so on
and so on.

90
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,100
This is actually a longer tax.

91
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,733
If you want, feel free
to pause the video, visit all this text.

92
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,400
But what did you want to know
what these reviews wrote

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,466
without having to stop
and read all this in detail.

94
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:34,766
So I'm going to set review
one to be just a product review

95
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:41,400
that we had up there.

96
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,600
And I'm going to put all of these reviews
into a list.

97
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,100
And now if I implement a

98
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,033
full loop over the

99
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:54,700
reviews, So here's my prompt

100
00:05:55,233 --> 00:06:00,066
and share of asset to summarize it
at most 20 words,

101
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:03,166
then let's have it

102
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,233
get the response

103
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:10,133
and print it out and let's run that

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,333
and it prints out

105
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,333
the first review asset and the toy review
summary, the review of the lamp,

106
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,400
some review of the toothbrush
and then the blender.

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,466
And so if you have

108
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,600
websites
where you have hundreds of reviews,

109
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,100
you can imagine how you might use this
to build a dashboard

110
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,233
to take huge numbers of reviews,
generally short summaries of them so that

111
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:40,233
you or someone else can browse
the reviews much more quickly.

112
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:46,033
And then if they wish, maybe click in
to see the original longer review.

113
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:49,233
And this can help you efficiently
get a better sense

114
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:53,300
of what
all of your customers are thinking.

115
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,533
Right?

116
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:57,400
So that's it for summarizing,
and I hope that you can picture

117
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,300
if you have any applications
with many pieces of text,

118
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,900
how you can use prompts like these
to summarize them, to help people quickly

119
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,866
get a sense of what's in the attacks,
the many pieces of text,

120
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,300
and perhaps optionally take in more
if they wish.

121
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,366
In the next video,
we'll look at another capability

122
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:19,333
of large language models,
which is to make inferences using texts.

123
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:20,600
For example,

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,066
what have you had a game product reviews
and you wanted to very quickly

125
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:29,066
get a sense of which product reviews
have a positive or negative sentiment.

126
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's take a look at
how to do that in the next video.
