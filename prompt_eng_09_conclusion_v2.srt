00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,300
Congratulations on
making it to the end of this short course.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,600
In summary, in this short course,
you'll learn

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,700
about two key principles
for prompting, right?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
Clear and specific instructions

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,800
and when it's appropriate,
give them all the time to think.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,066
You also learn
about iterative prompt development and how

7
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:25,800
having a process to get to the prompt
is right for your application is key.

8
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:29,766
And we went through a few capabilities
of large language models

9
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:33,066
that are useful for many applications,
specifically summarizing

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,000
and very transforming and expanding.

11
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,500
And you also saw
how to build a custom chat bot

12
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,233
that wasn't lost that you learned
in just one short course.

13
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:45,933
And I hope you enjoyed
going through these materials.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,800
We hope you'll come up with some ideas

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,633
for applications
that you can build yourself.

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,933
Now please go try this out
and let us know what you come up with.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,633
No application is too small.

18
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:58,000
It's fine to start with something
that's kind of a very small project

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,700
with maybe a little bit of utility,
or maybe it's not even useful at all.

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,300
It's just something fun.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,600
Yeah.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,100
And I find playing with these models
actually really fun.

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,333
So go play with it.

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,633
Yeah, I agree. It's a good weekend
activity.

25
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,066
Speaking from experience.

26
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:16,833
Oh, and just, you know, please
use the learnings from your first project

27
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,466
to build about a second project
and maybe even about a third project.

28
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,400
So on.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
That's
kind of how I have kind of grown over time

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,700
using these models myself as well.

31
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:28,033
Or if

32
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,933
you have an idea for a bigger
project already, just just go for it

33
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,200
and you know, as a reminder,

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,100
these kind of large language
models are a very powerful technology.

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,866
So it kind of goes without saying
that we ask you to use them responsibly

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,700
and please only build things
that will have a positive impact.

37
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,833
Yeah, I fully agree.

38
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,900
I think in this age, people that built
the AI systems can have a huge impact

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,366
on others.

40
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:53,166
So small, important than ever
that all of us only use these tools

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,133
responsibly.

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,800
And I think building large language
model based

43
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:02,566
applications is just a very exciting
and growing field right now.

44
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,666
And now that you've finished this course,
I think you now have a wealth

45
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:11,400
of knowledge to let you build things
that few people today know how to.

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,166
So I hope you also help us
to spread the word and encourage others

47
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,433
to take this course, too.

48
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,933
In closing, I hope you had fun during this

49
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,133
course and I want to thank you
for finishing this course

50
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:26,933
and both Ethan, I look forward to hearing
about the amazing things that you feel.
